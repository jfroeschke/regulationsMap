		<p>The Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council (Council) manages marine species in the federal waters of the Gulf of Mexico.  Managed species are included in fishery management plans (FMPs) and some FMPs include regulations associated with specific regions to protect sensitive habitat, spawning aggregations, allow equitable access to the fishery throughout the Gulf. This interactive appliation is intended to allow users to examine the spatial management tools that the Council uses to achieve the goals of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. </p>

        <p>  These management area maps and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) data represent the areas from Title 50 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 622, Fishery Management Plans (FMPs). These data are for areas that include the Gulf of Mexico and <b>are for illustrative purposes only </b>. The CFR (bottom right tab) should be consulted for the precise legal definition of the FMPs and geographic coordinates. </p>

		<p>The map layers can be displayed interactively using the controls on the left side of the application.  Below the map is a description of each management area.  The data, metada, and associated federal regulatins are also provided for reference.  
		<p>If you need any of the data in this application for your own use, or if you have any questions about using the application, please <a href = "mailto: portal@gulfcouncil.org">contact us</a>.</p>
