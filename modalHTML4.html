		<p><u><b>What does this mapping tool do?</b></u><br>
		This interactive map allows users to view fishery management areas, boundaries, and their associated fishing regulations in the Gulf of Mexico. </p>


<p><u><b>Where did the areas come from?</b></u><br>
These management areas were created by the Council to achieve the goals of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The maps and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) data areas can all be found in Title 50 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 622, Fishery Management Plans (FMPs). 
</p>


<p><u><b>How do I use this tool?</b></u><br>
The map layers can be displayed interactively using the controls on the left side of the application. Below the map is a description of each management area. The data, metadata, and associated federal regulations are also provided for reference. 

<p><u><b>Disclaimer</b></u><br>
These data are for areas that include the Gulf of Mexico and <b>are for illustrative purposes only</b>. The CFR (bottom right tab) should be consulted for the precise legal definition of the FMPs and geographic coordinates.
