       <h2>Spiny lobster management</h2>
       Spiny lobster are jointly managed by the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic Fishery Management Councils.  Originally this fishery management plan included the Caribbean spiny lobster, Panulirus argus, and other incidental species of lobster (spotted spiny lobster, Panulirus guttatus; smoothtail spiny lobster, Panulirus laevicauda; Spanish slipper lobster, Scyllarides aequinoctialis, and ridged slipper lobster, Scyllarides nodifer) which inhabit or migrate through coastal waters and the exclusive economic zone (between 9 and 200 nautical miles) of the Gulf of Mexico and the South Atlantic.  In 2012, the incidental species were removed.  Leaving only the Caribbean spiny lobster in the fishery management unit.  
Management of this species is accomplished through catch and size limits, gear restrictions, closed seasons, and closed areas.  More information on the management of spiny lobster can be found here:

<h2>Why are these areas closed to spiny lobster trap fishing</h2>
     <p>NOAA Fisheries Service and the Gulf and South Atlantic Fishery Management Councils have created closed areas to protect threatened staghorn and elkhorn coral (Acropora spp.) Prohibiting the use of lobster traps near these corals reduces their risk of damage due to trap movement caused mostly by storms.</p>

<h2>Why are these corals protected?</h2>
<p>Staghorn and elkhorn corals are a food source and provide important habitat for many different fish and invertebrates including spiny lobster. Staghorn and elkhorn coral populations have been reduced by 90-95% since 1980.
